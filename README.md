Project: Cryptoby
========

Cryptoby is a simple Java Tool for end- and dectyption of files.

It uses two forms of encyrption:

1. A symmetric encyrption based on AES ??
2. A asymmetric encryption based on ?? (ECDH, ECDSA)

These cryptograhic algorithms are directly implemented in the source code of tool. That means, it doesn't use any cryptographic libraries from Java or elsewhere. Further, the random number generator and primnumber test are also implemented.

## Project Setup

_How do I, as a developer, start working on the project?_ 

1. _What dependencies does it have (where are they expressed) and how do I install them?_
2. _How can I see the project working before I change anything?_

## Testing

_How do I run the project's automated tests?_

### Unit Tests

1. `rake spec`

### Integration Tests

1. _Run other local services / provide credentials for external services._
2. `rake spec:integration`

## Deploying

### _How to setup the deployment environment_

- _Required heroku addons, packages, or chef recipes._
- _Required environment variables or credentials not included in git._
- _Monitoring services and logging._

### _How to deploy_

## Troubleshooting & Useful Tools

_Examples of common tasks_

> e.g.
> 
> - How to make curl requests while authenticated via oauth.
> - How to monitor background jobs.
> - How to run the app through a proxy.
